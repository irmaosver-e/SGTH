# Spot Goes to Hollywood (Mega Drive) — Quality of Life ROM Hack

This ROM hack upgrades the *Spot Goes to Hollywood* experience on the Sega Mega Drive with a set of quality-of-life improvements:

## Features
- **New Control Scheme:**  
  Choose between two control styles from the Options menu:  
  - **Original:** Classic isometric movement (up/down/left/right = diagonal directions).
  - **Revamped:** Direct movement based on button input (up moves up, left moves left, etc.).
  
- **SRAM Password Saving:**  
  After clearing a stage, the last password you received is automatically saved to SRAM. This makes it easier to continue your game after a reset — no need to re-enter passwords manually.

- **Region Lock Disabled:**  
  The game’s region lock has been removed, allowing it to run on any hardware regardless of region.

## Requirements
To apply this patch, you will need the original ROM:

- **ROM Title:** Spot Goes to Hollywood (U) (REV01) [!]
- **SHA-1:** `064A384F745EEFFEE3621D55A0278C133ABDBC11`
- **CRC32:** `BDAD1CBC`

## How to Patch
1. Obtain the required ROM file.
2. Apply the included `.ips` patch using a patching tool like [Floating IPS (Flips)](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/1040/).
3. Load the patched ROM on your favorite emulator or flash cartridge and enjoy!

## Notes
- Save data is stored automatically in SRAM when a password is obtained.
- Control scheme selection is available from the standard Options menu.
- No other gameplay or graphical changes were made — the experience remains faithful to the original with smoother handling and easier game continuation.
